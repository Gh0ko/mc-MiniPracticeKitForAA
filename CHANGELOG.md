# Changelog

## v0.5

New features:

- Use white shulker box triggers to obtain items in a random order
  - These work just like chest triggers, except the items are shuffled
- The Eye Spy preset now creates a lit portal and places you next to it (as if double traveling into the stronghold), for more realistic pre-emptive practice

Changes:

- The post-bastion presets now randomize the order of the inner inventory items (excluding hotbar and top left flint-and-steel), using the new white shulker box trigger

## v0.4

New features:

- Use brown/red/orange/yellow shulker box triggers to obtain a random selection of items
  - Each of these 4 colors acts as a separate "pool" - for example, if there are multiple red shulker box triggers, you'll obtain the items from exactly one of them
- Select "blind modes" to choose whether to automatically build the portal and/or go through it to the Overworld

## v0.3

New features:

- Add triggers for teleporting to nearby Nether structures

## v0.2

Fixes:

- Fix no-trigger warning always appearing
- Avoid occasional fall damage when teleporting to stronghold in 1.17+

## v0.1

Initial release.
